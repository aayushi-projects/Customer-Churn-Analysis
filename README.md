ðŸ“Š TCA (Time Component Analysis) Project

This project involves analyzing temporal data to decompose and understand the underlying **trend, seasonality, and residual** components using Python. The analysis is useful for identifying patterns over time, detecting anomalies, and making informed forecasts in real-world datasets.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

To perform time-series decomposition using Python libraries to extract key temporal patterns (trend, seasonality, noise) and enhance data-driven forecasting or decision-making.

ðŸ§  Techniques Used

1. Data Loading & Exploration

   * `pandas` for loading `.csv` data and converting date columns.
   * Basic inspection with `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.describe()`.

2. Datetime Handling

   * `pd.to_datetime()` to convert strings to datetime objects.
   * Sorting and indexing by date for time-series analysis.

3. Visualization

   * Line plots with `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to observe overall trends.
   * Seasonal/cyclical plots across months or years.

4. Time-Series Decomposition

   * `statsmodels.tsa.seasonal_decompose()` to split the series into:

     * Trend (long-term direction)
     * Seasonality (repeating patterns)
     * Residual (random noise)

5. Handling Missing or Anomalous Data

   * Forward/backward fill or interpolation for missing timestamps.
   * Optional outlier detection and removal.

6. Frequency Resampling

   * `.resample()` to aggregate data (e.g., monthly or quarterly) for smoother trends.

7. Rolling Statistics

   * `.rolling().mean()` for moving-average smoothing, reducing noise and clarifying long-term patterns.


ðŸ“ˆ Insights Derived

* Identified rising or falling trends over time.
* Detected seasonal spikes or dips across specific periods.
* Separated irregular events or noise from meaningful patterns.
